# valentine

This is a Flutter application that presents a playful and interactive Valentine's Day proposal to the user. The application uses the `animated_background` and `lottie` packages to create a visually appealing and dynamic interface.

The main screen of the application displays a question "Will you be my Valentine?" along with two options: "Yes" and "No". The "No" button dynamically changes its text and size based on the number of times it is clicked, presenting a series of persuasive messages to the user. If the user selects "Yes", a celebratory message and animation are displayed.

The application also includes a floating action button that redirects the user to a LinkedIn profile when clicked.

Please note that this application uses the `dart:html` library, so it is not suitable for platforms other than web.
